* Coded the basic level coding of creating the anode and cathode
* Created the BCD converter, which would convert a binary into BCD digits to use in the 7-segment display
* Created a top-level module, which is the FSM state machine, and combined all the code so that it would work coherently
* Implemented the debouncer and the two different clocks into the Verilog code
* Created the 7-segment display and coded the anode portion of the code so that the FSM would go through each digit on the 7-segment display very quickly
